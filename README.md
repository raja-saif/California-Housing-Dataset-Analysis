# California-Housing-Dataset-Analysis
Comprehensive machine learning analysis of the California Housing dataset using NumPy, Scikit-learn, and statistical regression techniques.
CALIFORNIA HOUSING DATASET ANALYSIS
====================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the California Housing Dataset using various regression techniques and statistical methods. The analysis is conducted in 5 phases, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning model development and evaluation.

REQUIREMENTS
============
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

INSTALLATION
============
1. Install required packages:
   pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

2. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed:
   pip install jupyter

FILES INCLUDED
==============
1. california_housing_analysis.ipynb - Main analysis notebook
2. report.pdf - Comprehensive report
3. README.txt - This instruction file

HOW TO RUN
==========
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open california_housing_analysis.ipynb
4. Run all cells sequentially (Cell → Run All)
5. Wait for all visualizations to complete

NOTE: The notebook may take 2-3 minutes to run completely due to cross-validation.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
=================
Phase 1: Dataset Loading [15 points]
- Load California Housing dataset from sklearn
- Display features and target in array format
- Show data statistics without using Pandas

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis [25 points]
- Compute descriptive statistics using NumPy
- Analyze skewness in all features
- Generate correlation matrix and heatmap
- Create distribution visualizations

Phase 3: Regression Experiments [30 points]
Part A: Single-Column Regression
- Linear vs Polynomial regression on Median Income
- Compare MSE, MAE, R2, RMSE metrics
- Analyze overfitting risks

Part B: Multi-Column Regression
- Use all 8 features for regression
- Create engineered features (square/cubic terms)
- Compare original vs engineered features

Phase 4: Model Implementation [25 points]
- 80/20 train-test split
- Apply standardization
- Implement Linear Regression and SGD Regressor
- Comprehensive error analysis with 12 visualizations

Phase 5: K-fold Cross-Validation [15 points]
- 5-fold cross-validation for both models
- Statistical significance testing
- Model stability analysis

KEY FEATURES
============
✅ NumPy-based statistical analysis (no Pandas used)
✅ Custom skewness calculation function
✅ Comprehensive correlation analysis
✅ Polynomial regression with degree optimization
✅ Feature engineering (square/cubic terms)
✅ Model comparison with multiple metrics
✅ Cross-validation with statistical testing
✅ 20+ professional visualizations
✅ Evidence-based conclusions

EXPECTED OUTPUTS
================
- Dataset statistics and correlation analysis
- Model performance comparison tables
- Comprehensive visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Polynomial regression optimization results
- Cross-validation stability analysis
- Statistical significance testing results

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
1. If you get import errors, ensure all packages are installed
2. If plots don't display, restart kernel and run again
3. For memory issues, run cells individually instead of "Run All"
4. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for visualizations

RESULTS INTERPRETATION
======================
- R² Score: Higher is better (0-1 range)
- MSE/MAE/RMSE: Lower is better
- Cross-validation: More stable models have lower standard deviation
- Correlation: |r| > 0.7 indicates strong correlation
- Skewness: |skewness| > 1 indicates highly skewed data

REPORT GENERATION
=================
The comprehensive report (report.pdf) contains:
- All actual results from notebook execution
- Statistical analysis and interpretations
- Model performance comparisons
- Evidence-based conclusions
- Figure references for visualizations

SUBMISSION CHECKLIST
